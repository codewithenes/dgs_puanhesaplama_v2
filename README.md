DGS Puan Hesaplama AracÄ± V2


DGS is an exam in Turkey. while I am studying DGS i have been using DGS Calculating websites maybe more than twice a day.
The main problem was websites gave differents Marks when i tryin to get my calculated mark. After few times I decided to do an app
which is gives the right marks then the other websites. I Hope gives you to right marks.


UPDATE: Lots of friend use that codes for learn their own marks but when they gave high Math and Language numbers like 35-38+ 
they realize the calculator gave very high and unreal marks. with v2 this problem solved.
