DGS Puan Hesaplama Aracı V2


DGS (Vertical Transfer Exam) is a significant test in Turkey. While preparing for it, I frequently used various DGS calculating websites—often more than twice a day. I noticed a recurring issue: these websites often provided inconsistent results when I calculated my marks.

To address this problem, I decided to develop an app that delivers accurate marks, unlike the other websites. I hope it proves to be reliable for you.

UPDATE: Many of my friends have used this app to check their marks. However, they encountered a problem when entering high Math and Language scores (e.g., 35-38+). The initial versions of the calculator often produced unrealistically high results. This issue has been resolved in version 2 of the app.
